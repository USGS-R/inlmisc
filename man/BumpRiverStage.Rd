\title{Adjust Implausible River Stage}
\usage{
BumpRiverStage(r, outlets, min.drop = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{'RasterLayer'.
Numeric cell values representing river stages.}

\item{outlets}{'SpatialPoints*', 'SpatialLines*', 'SpatialPolygons*' or 'Extent'.
Designates the location of discharge outlets.
The \code{\link{rasterize}} function is used to locate outlet cells in the raster grid \code{r}.}

\item{min.drop}{'numeric' number.
Minimum drop in stage between adjacent river cells.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'RasterLayer' with cell values representing the vertical change in stream stage.
  These changes can be added to \code{r} to ensure that water always flows downhill.
}
\description{
Decrease stage values in river cells if they are implausible
with respect to water always flowing downhill.
}
\details{
The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_algorithm}{Lee algorithm} (Lee, 1961)
  is used to identify flow paths among the modeled river cells.
  An analysis of river cell stage values along a flow path identifies any problematic cells
  that are obstructing downhill surface-water flow.
  Stage values for these problematic cells are then lowered to an acceptable elevation.
