\arguments{
\item{n}{'integer' count.
Maximum permissible index, that is, the length of the finite sequence (\code{1:n}).
The GA chooses a subset from this sequence.}

\item{k}{'integer' count.
Number of indices to choose, that is, the fixed size of the subset.}

\item{Fitness}{'function'.
Fitness function, also known as the objective function, is any allowable \R function which
takes as its first argument the binary \code{string} representing a potential solution.
And as its second argument the maximum permissible index, \code{n}.
Use the \code{\link{DecodeChromosome}(string, n)} command to decode the binary \code{string}.
The fitness function returns a single numerical value describing its fitness.
Recall that the GA searches for a maximum fitness value.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the fitness function.}

\item{popSize}{'integer' count.
Population size that is distributed evenly between islands.}

\item{numIslands}{'integer' count.
Number of islands}

\item{migrationRate}{'numeric' number.
Proportion of individuals that should migrate between islands.}

\item{migrationInterval}{'integer' count.
Number of generations at which exchange of individuals (or migration) takes place.
This interval between migrations is called an \emph{epoch}.}

\item{pcrossover}{'numeric' number.
Probability of crossover between pairs of chromosomes.}

\item{pmutation}{'numeric' number.
Probability of mutation in a parent chromosome.}

\item{elitism}{'integer' count.
Number of chromosomes to survive into the next generation.
Defaults to 5-percent of the island population.}

\item{maxiter}{'integer' count.
Maximum number of generations to run on each island before the GA search is halted.}

\item{run}{'integer' count.
Number of consecutive generations without any improvement in the
\dQuote{best} fitness value before the GA is stopped.}

\item{suggestions}{integer 'matrix'.
Integer chromosomes to be included in the initial population.
See returned \code{solution} component for a suggested value for this argument.}

\item{parallel}{'logical' flag or 'integer' count.
Whether to use parallel computing.
This argument can also be used to specify the number of cores to employ; by default,
this is the number of physical CPUs/cores.
The \pkg{parallel} and \pkg{doParallel} packages must be
installed for parallel computing to work.}

\item{monitor}{'function'.
Function that takes as input the current state of the \code{\link[=gaisl-class]{gaisl-class}} object,
and is run at each epoch of the islands GA search.}

\item{seed}{'integer' count.
Random number generator state for random number generation, used to replicate the results.
The \pkg{doRNG} package must be installed if using parallel computing.}
}
\value{
A 'list' with components:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{call}}{original call which can be used for later re-use.}
    \item{\code{solution}}{a 'matrix' representation of the best solution found.
      Each row represents a unique solution giving the best fitness at the final generation.
      More than one row indicates a non-unique solution.
      The number of columns is equal to the subset size \code{k}.}
    \item{\code{ga_output}}{output from the ISLPGAs,
      see \code{\link[=gaisl-class]{gaisl-class}} for format description.}
    \item{\code{ga_time}}{time required to run the ISLPGAs,
      see \code{\link{system.time}} for details.}

}
\description{
Find optimal subset of a fixed size \code{k} from a finite sequence of length \code{n}.
A distributed multiple-population genetic algorithm (GA) is used to do
subset selection based on the maximization of a user-supplied fitness function.
}
\details{
The fitness function (see \code{Fitness} argument) is solved using
  the \code{\link[GA]{gaisl}} function in the \pkg{GA} package (Scrucca, 2013, 2016).
  The function implements an islands evolution model (first proposed by Cohoon and others, 1987).
  to maximize a fitness function using islands parallel genetic algorithms (ISLPGAs)
  (Luke, 2013, p. 103-104; Scrucca, 2016, p. 197-200).
  Independent GAs are configured to use integer chromosomes
  represented with a binary codification, linear-rank selection,
  uniform crossover, and uniform mutation.
